					<h1>Just For You</h1>
					<p style="color:red;font-size:25px;;">When you see kankei in the beganing he seems like the average human. Until he meets up with his crush. Now you would think this is a love story from the that scene. But if you were paying attetion to the beganing you can cleary see a bit of forshadowing. But this week character is the iconic protaginost for this anime. so if anything else its giving you the personality of this woman.
					<br>
					Now why would the artist foreshadow the personality of this woman. Not just that, why Allow kankei (the clear protagnist) meet this dangerous woman. But due the story line Kankei would've meet a ghoul eventually. But with saying that does this mean. Its possible he Trying to prove a point. But at first glance you wont get it. I mean a new type of humans, Know as ghouls. Who eat human beings to survive. That they live among us. But dont worry you'll find out soon enough. 
					</p>
					<p style="color:red;font-size:25px;"> Now watching this would be a shocker anyways. The woman ends up dying. If thats not bad enough she dies trying to kill kankei. She ended up dying, while kankei was on life support they decided to put her organs in his body. Now I was wondering dont they have to do test before they do organ transfer. Not just that but wouldnt the blood show her blood of a ghoul. This should be the first sign that this was a bad idea.
					<br>
					But mid series of root a of tokyo ghoul. You find out that a doctor was actually testing with organ transplants from ghouls. It would have seemed that kankei was the subject of that test. But he wasnt the only one who was alive with ghoul organs. So this is what the world of tokyo ghoul came to. But not to mention kankei friend Hideyoshi Nagachika somehow knew his secret. But their more. hide was able to also get info through the law enforcement for ghouls and find his friend kankei. What made this story sad the most was when hide sacraficed himself towards the end to save his friend. He was shot and kankei was weakend. So hide said to eat him.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size:25px;color:red;"> kankei was devistated and ended up carring his dead friend to the ghoul enforcemnt. Asking repeatedly not to look at him. I figured he was ashamed and mad at himself.

					You have to think this is just horrible and hes a monster. but i believe its far from it. this just shows their bond as friend. how they saw themselves together. Makes you rethink the monsters in this world. So yes this anime was amazing and well thought through.Sui Ishida did amazing job making this. I'd like to see him create another anime and master his art. He had made this world rethink friendship in this anime alone.

					<p style="font-size:25px; color:red;"> When all said and done this anime shows the power of friendship. But also the power you can get from those who are you true friendships. You may feel like a monster or living with monster all around. But your true friends will always be their to help and/or save you. Personally I think it was awesome for hide to have know that kankei wasnt a human anymore. Actually he knew all along. Ever since he became one. But it didnt affect his out look of kankei. Actually it made him try to save and help kankei. Hide even died for his friend. Which in turn brought kankei to his senses. So I would Highly recommened this anime. I give it 10/10. Both on the story and art work. The theme song was also good. All round I really did enjoy the series.</p>
