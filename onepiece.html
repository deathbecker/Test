	At one point we've all seen one piece. Weither by accident or for a joke. But I dont think One piece isnt that bad. The story is set in a world run by law and disrupted by pirates. But if you keep watching you learn that the local law enforcement isnt all it seems to be. Sinking islands and killing inocents. Our main character Monkey D. luffy wants to stop this. How will he do that...... Easy, Become the pirate king. Luffy wants to become the moneky king and change everything. Now luffy does have a special power. He has gum gum power. Now this might sound strange but in this world their fruits called devil fruits. these fruit will give you power the its named for. But most devil fruits have a horrible side effect. Luffy's devil fruit makes him like rubber. Amzing you'd think right. Well his side effect is that he can never swim again. Now isnt that ashamful think
	<br>
	But dont worry he only had to learn this the hard way. Luffy grew up on an island alone. But was raised by its people.
