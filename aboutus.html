<h1>About the team</h1>
<p style="font-size:25px;color:black; text-align: center;">
This was made by me Mr.Weeabo. I did have a little help along the way. Many times while making this I was confused and upset. Many of codes I used didnt work. I had to check it and have other people recheck it for me. Although i was done within a 6 weeks. It was still long and hard road. (But we never stop inovation and shall continue.)D

Now im not complaing. I enjoyed it. This is my first website I had made using codes. Personally I thought I could never did. So I had Practice and progress with class. So this website had been made as I learned the code. So in a way this is proof I payed attention. But I have to be honest though it was fun. I have all my knowledge of coding to the at bitwise acdemey. They helped alot. Even made me laugh (sort of).
